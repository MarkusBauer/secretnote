    For the note you'll get a <span class="text-primary">secret link</span>:
    Only with this link your recipient can decrypt and read the note.
    After your note has been read it will be removed permanently - no one else will be able to see it.
</p>
<p i18n>With a second <span class="text-danger">admin link</span> you will be able to see when your note has been read.</p>
<p><small i18n>Notes are deleted after they have been read once, latest 7 days after creation.</small></p>
